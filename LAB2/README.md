Lab Exercise Question
You are supposed to create a menu-driven program that has the following menu options:
Enter a name
Search for a name
Remove a name
Show all names
Note:
The menu-driven program has to be made with the help of a do-while loop and switch-case statements.
Constraints:
The names collected must be stored in an array with a max length of 1024.
The names in the array should be UNIQUE; no duplicate entries are expected!
Provide necessary validations that the user enters only valid names that are not going to be repeated.
Removing a name should not create empty space inside the array!
Format your results properly!!

# Define class
# Declare scanner class
# start do while loop by printing and asking different choices under do bloc
# start switch case depending on the inputs under the print statements
# Add conditions according to questions
# Ask for name,check validity and add the name if not present
# Search for name if present then return that otherwise not present
# Remove name and fill empty cells
# show all names
# give default as whether the user want to continue or not
# start while block and exit the program from there
# end of the program
